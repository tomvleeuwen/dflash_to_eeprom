# The "FRM3" and other Electronic Control Units contain the             #
# MC9S12XEQ384 microprocessor with integrated Flash. When the           #
# integrated Flash is used in eeprom emulation mode, like in the case   #
# of the FRM3, the settings can get corrupted making the ECU unable to  #
# access the eeprom again. The ECU can be repaired by programming the   #
# correct data in the (simulated) eeprom.                               #
#                                                                       #
# This tool allows the corrupt data in the microprocessor to be read,   #
# even after the eeprom got corrupted. This is done by reading the      #
# d-flash contents from the microcontroller using an appropriate        #
# programmer (like xprog), after which this program can convert it to   #
# an eeprom image which can then be programmed to the simulated eeprom  #
# area again using the same programmer.                                 #
#
# This script runs under the following assumptions: The Flash is used   #
# as a circular buffer, where each flash block can contain zero to 63   #
# "eeprom commands", which "update" the data in the simulated  eeprom.  #
# It is assumed that an eeprom word starts as 0xFF, and can be written  #
# by adding a command to the flash. It can be overwritten by adding     #
# another command to the flash (The flash cannot be erased at word-     #
# level, and the block can still contain valid commands for a different #
# address, so it has to keep the old command). Thus, the order of       #
# commands matter. It is assumed that a block that has its header set   #
# to FFFFFFFE is  prepared to become the next block to be written to.   #
# It is also assumed that a block that is not completely filled with    #
# commands is the current block, which shall be located just before the #
# prepared block. If none of these conditions are found, it just        #
# searches for the longest chain of empty blocks (header starts with    #
# 0xFFFF and not 0xFACF), and assumes that these are the prepared       #
# blocks.                                                               #
#                                                                       #
# This is all just based on looking to a D-flash dump, so there might   #
# be more magic. However, the resuling eeprom file looks reasonable,    #
# however I did not yet have the chance to test the results.            #
#                                                                       #
